  Visual cues, confirmation messages, and consistent feedback throughout the booking flow reassure users that their actions are successful and secure.

## üß± UI Component Patterns

The Airbnb Clone Project follows a **component-based architecture** that promotes code reusability, scalability, and consistency throughout the user interface.  
Each component serves a distinct purpose in enhancing user experience and maintaining design uniformity.
