# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a web application inspired by the Airbnb platform.  
The goal of this project is to recreate the core user experience of browsing and viewing property listings while applying front-end technologies I’m currently mastering through the **ALX Frontend Development Program**.

This project helps me strengthen my understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React** — building clean, responsive interfaces and reusable components for real-world applications.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a responsive, user-friendly **Airbnb-style interface**.  
- Apply **React.js** concepts such as components, props, and state.  
- Practice **modern JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactivity and logic.  
- Improve **CSS layout and styling skills** using Flexbox and Grid.  
- Strengthen my **Git and GitHub workflow** through proper version control.  
- Prepare for integration with backend APIs or dynamic data in future phases.
